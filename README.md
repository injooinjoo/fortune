# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## TODO

This repository currently focuses on a Next.js implementation. A request was
made to integrate Jetpack Navigation Compose for an Android version, but no
Android module exists yet. If Android support is added in the future, set up
Navigation Compose with a `Screen` sealed class (`Home`, `Tarot`, `Saju`,
`More`) and a `NavHost` inside `MainActivity.kt` using
`rememberNavController()`.
